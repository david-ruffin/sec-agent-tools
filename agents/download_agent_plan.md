   - Handle API authentication errors (401)
   - Handle rate limiting (429)
   - Handle not found errors (404)
   - Handle server errors (500)

4. Best Practices
   - Implement rate limiting (max 10 requests per second)
   - Support resume functionality for interrupted downloads
   - Implement progress tracking for large downloads
   - Support proxy configuration for corporate environments
   - Maintain organized file structure for downloads
